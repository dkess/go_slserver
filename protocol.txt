# Hosting a new co-op game

Connect to the websocket with path:

	/ws/hostcoop/<playername>

Where <playername> is the name of the player hosting.

The first message should be a list of lowercase words, separated by spaces. Words that have already been guessed should be suffixed with a _. The order is not significant. Example where ate, cap, and pace have been guessed:

ace accept act ape apt ate_ cap_ cape cat eat pace_ pact pat pate pea peat pet tap tape tea

The server will respond with

	<gamename>

Where <gamename> is this game's identifier. Identifiers for co-op games will always begin with the letter 'c'.

# Joining a game

A client joining a game that has already started should connect with this path:

	/ws/join/<gamename>

If that game does not exist, the server will respond with

	:noexist

and disconnect. If the lobby does exist, the server will respond with

	:ok

The client then sends their name

	<name>

The server will respond with

	:badname

if the name is invalid or

	:taken

if it is already in use. If this name is ok, the server will send

	:player <y/n> <playername>

For each player currently in the game. The <y/n> will be y if the player is in the game, or n if the player joined but later left. When all of the players have been sent, the server will send

	:endplayers

Then the server will send

	:word <word>

for each word in the game. Once all words have been sent, the server will send

	:endwords

the server will then send all of the correct words that have been attempted, using the :attempt format described below.

Then, the server will send all of the players that have voted to give up, using the format described below.

# Gameplay

After attempting any word, the player sends this to the server:

	:attempt <word>

When any user attempts a word and sends it to the server, the following is sent to everyone else in the game, EXCEPT the user who attempted the word.

	:attempt <word> <playername>

When a user successfully joins a game (this happens when they get the ":ok" response from the server, the following is sent to everyone else already in the game:

	:join <playername>

When a player quits, the server will send this message:

	:quit <playername>

To vote to give up, the player sends this to the server:

	:giveup

When a player votes to give up, the following is sent to everyone else in the game, EXCEPT the user who placed the vote:

	:giveup <playername>

If all players have given up, the server sends this to all players:

	:allgiveup

If a player removes their vote to give up, the above two messages should be sent, but with :ungiveup instead of :giveup.

If a player quits, their vote to give up should be removed.

ACCEPTABLE PLAYER NAMES (should be implemented on both server and client side)
* Names may only be made up of letters and numbers.
* Names must be between 1 and 10 characters long.
